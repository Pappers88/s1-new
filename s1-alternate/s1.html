                <img class="nwsimg" src="pics/news4.jpg" style="width: 100%">
                <p>People say I’m too nice…<br>
“I am nice, yeah, I’m cool. But I’m no push-over. And if someone gets one over on me, they’ve done it when my eyes were closed, and it doesn’t happen twice. My attitude is I’m cool, but no one pushes me around: not the President or the Queen, or the tramp on the street. I treat everyone equally, and if you treat me with respect you get the same back. But treat me with disrespect and we have a problem… just don’t make me angry because you really wouldn’t like me when I’m angry [laughs].”</p>

<p>I don’t see myself as just a boxer…<br>
“At the moment, I still think of myself as a man who fights. My mind-set at the moment is that I don’t want the sport to consume me or define me, because when it comes to an end I worry that I won’t be able to come to terms with life without boxing. But I am working towards changing that. I am a boxer and I want to be the world’s greatest fighter, but I am not there yet because of my attitude. The mentality I have at the moment is that I am just an ordinary guy, I feel humble when people want to meet me, take a picture with me, all of that stuff. I don’t take it for granted because deep down it doesn’t make sense to me. I mean, at my last weigh-in two women fainted. How mad is that?”</p>

<p>Don’t call me a celebrity…<br>
“It’s hard to say I don’t like being famous, but how I feel is that I don’t see myself as that person. It baffles me that people would want a picture with me. Because in my mind I am just Joe Bloggs who happens to box. And a lot of it is down to the media, who have built me up and said very positive things about me, raised my profile, made me popular. But what worries me is, what happens when they start saying negative things about me? Will people be as quick to believe that? I guess they will, because they don’t really know the real me. People are human, people make mistakes, people can make amends for their failures. So I don’t feel special and I don’t feel that I deserve more attention or admiration than anyone else. I’d like people to realise we are all equal.”</p>

<p>When you get hurt, you have to decide how to respond…<br>
“Physically, my toughest fight was against Dillian [White]. He got inside my head, and I didn’t think he had. But I was rushing things and then he caught me with a punch-perfect shot in the second round, and that rocked me. I didn’t even realise I was that badly hurt until I suddenly saw him start throwing lots of shots. But as soon as it happened, I started processing what was happening. My first thought was: ‘I could go down here. Take a knee. Recover. Get back to work.’ But then I thought, ‘No… I‘m not going down.’ Then it is a question of trying to re-group without taking too much punishment.</p>

<p>Don’t believe the hype…<br>
“People have built me up to be untouchable, unbeatable, invincible, and I’m not that. I am a man and I am a winner, but that can change in a second. That’s boxing. But professional athletes, professional fighters, we’re not gods, we’re not superheroes… we are just human and we make mistakes. People are people, and the public shouldn’t follow the hype. They should follow the realness, follow the struggle. Because that means something.”</p>

<img class="nwsimg" src="https://gq-images.condecdn.net/image/1LBK8agJAk2/crop/810" style="width: 100%">

<p>David Haye is desperate to fight me…<br>
“Honestly, I have never seen a man so confident in his own abilities than David. But what I would say is that he is very judgemental about every other fighter out there, but not so critical of himself. He hasn’t come back and fought the best opponents, but to hear him talk you wouldn’t think it. But he’s a smart guy, has a level of street knowledge, and he is very successful at the boxing business. We have talked about fighting, but I am not in a rush… we will fight when I’m ready, not just because he wants it… No man controls me.”</p>

<p>
  Boxing has opened a lot of doors for me…<br>
“Back in the day when I was hustling, grinding with my friends, we used to drive around and look at the big houses and it used to fascinate me: what does that guy do for a living? I wanted to live that life, but I didn’t know how to get there. So now that I have made a little money and I am recognised, those guys in their houses invite me, talk to me about business and help me understand how to handle it, and they give me that information for free. That is my indulgence now – learning about finance, investments, planning for my future and understanding how it all works.”
</p>

<p>There is only one voice that counts… your own!<br>
“My last camp was the hardest camp I have ever had – there were problems in training because I was ill, then I damaged my hand. But everyone was telling me I was going to knock this guy out in a couple of rounds. And I knew I was capable of that, so you start believing it. And then five, six rounds later I was thinking: ‘You can never listen to the opinion of anyone!’”</p>

<img class="nwsimg" src="https://gq-images.condecdn.net/image/p9pdlQvN7Xz/crop/810" style="width: 100%">

<p>The worst punches are the ones you don’t see. Or even feel…<br>
“When you are caught with a big shot, you don’t really feel it. It’s like being in a car-crash, and maybe your arm has been ripped off… it is only when you look down at it that you realise it has happened. In that fight with Dillian, I only realised he’d caught me when he started winging away with massive shots trying to knock me out. That’s when I thought, ‘OK, let me get myself together for a second and see what I can do.’”</p>

<p>With boxing, you have to keep your cool, even if you don’t feel cool…<br>
“Against [Dominic] Brazeale, I had to assess what he was doing, what I was going to do, how I was feeling, controlling the pace, keeping calm emotionally… it all happens so quickly, but in the ring there is no hiding place. I was having success, but it was a long fight and I did start to think: ‘Man, this guy is just waiting for one chance to land a shot to knock me out.’ Your opponent analyses your every move, and you analyse his, so a lot of it is mind games. You don’t want your opponent to think that you are tired, that you’ve been hurt, that you have any kind of problem. You want to hide that stuff. I’ve been hurt in sparring and you just have to mask it.”</p>

<p>I have been knocked down in sparring. But not for a while…<br>
“When I first started out and I was a novice, yeah it was tough and I did get put over. When you go down, you just have to put it down to experience. It isn’t nice, but you have to learn from it, build yourself back up, come back stronger. And make sure it doesn’t happen again.”</p>

<p>I am a work in progress…<br>
“Really, I would say I am only at 50 per cent of my potential right now. I still make silly mistakes, I don’t get enough sleep, I don’t always stretch as well as I should, my diet could be better, and I need to keep improving the boxing team around me so that they can bring out the best in me. At the moment, I would say I live like an ordinary, everyday man… not like a full-time athlete.”</p>

                    <div class="modal-body">
                     
                      <p>OHARA DAVIES demonstrated in brutal fashion why he is one of British boxing’s top prospects with a third-round knockout of Derry Mathews.</p><br>

                    <p>And after the fight, Mathews revealed the defeat was one too many, and confirmed he is retiring from the sport.</p><br>
                    <img class="nwsimg" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/nintchdbpict0003065837491-e1488660072951.jpg?strip=all&w=960" style="width: 100%">

                    <p>From the off it was clear Mathews was well out of his depth. Davies had far too much power, speed and nous around the ring and it was inevitable a stoppage win would be the order of the day.</p>

                    <p>That came in the third round. Davies, who used The Undertaker’s theme tune as his entrance music, landed a shuddering four-punch combination that sent Liverpudlian Mathews to the canvas.</p><br>

<p>The brave veteran got to his feet, but a matter of seconds later, he was down again. A flurry of heavy hands sent Mathews onto his haunches, and despite getting up, it was clear it was game over.</p><br>

<p>In the build up to the fight, Davies exclusively told The Sun he was looking forward to gorging on Five Guys, KFC and Burger King after the bout.</p><br>

<p>Then, in the post fight interviews, Mathews revealed that fight would be his last and that he would retire from boxing as he sat on the ring apron.</p><br>

<p>He said: “He’s very good, I felt the power in the first round. All the trash talk has been done, the better man won on the night.</p><br>

<p>“It’s been a good journey. I know it’s the end.”</p><br>

<p>Mathews also tweeted: “Kills me to write this but 15 years as a pro fighter as (sic) caught up with me.</p><br>

<p>“Message to young up and coming fighters enjoy your journey.”</p><br>

<br>

                      <p>Callum Smith’s WBC world super-middleweight title fight against Anthony Dirrell could be confirmed within days, trainer Joe Gallagher says</p><br>

<p>Smith is set to battle Dirrell for the vacant title, which was relinquished by Badou Jack, who decided to step up to light-heavyweight following his draw against James DeGale in January</p><br>

<p>Dirrell is bidding to reclaim the title he lost to Jack in 2015 and Gallagher knows his man faces a difficult task, particularly with the fight likely to take place in Dirrell's home state of Michigan.</p><br>

<p>"We're nearly over the line with negotiations," Gallagher told Sky Sports News HQ.</p><br>

<p>"I think contracts should be signed this week and we're probably looking at the back end of May or early June for that fight.</p><br>

<p>"It looks like we will most probably have to go over to Detroit or Flint, Michigan. That's what we're talking about at the moment.</p><br>

<p>"Anthony Dirrell is a very, very good fighter and a very good puncher and is highly motivated.</p><br>

<p>"He's got a world title opportunity in his own back garden and I'm sure he'll want to become a two-time world champion as much as Callum Smith wants to become a world champion."</p><br>
